The meego-ux-alarms daemon is responsible for displaying hard notifications and playing
associated audio, where a hard notification take over the user experience and forces the
user to respond.

There are four types of events supported:

* incoming call
* tasks reminder
* calendar event reminder
* alarm clock alarms

Incoming call request come directly from meego-ux-daemon and take priority over all other events.
All other notification events directly come from EDS via the libealarm library.
